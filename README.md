# Interview Scheduler
Interview Scheduler is a single-page application that allows users to book technical interviews between students and mentors. A user can make, edit and delete an appointment.

The front end was built with React and makes requests to the [scheduler-api](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/scheduler-api) server to fetch and store appointment data.
